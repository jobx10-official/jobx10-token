## 🛡 Smart Contract Governance

The JX10 contract is:

- **Non-upgradable**  
- **Fixed supply**  
- **Without admin-only mint or burn functions**  
- **Without proxy pattern**

This means:

- No governance votes can modify the contract  
- No upgrades can be executed  
- The contract remains permanently immutable  

Governance applies to the **ecosystem**, not the **token contract itself**.

Governance decisions include:

- Roadmap updates  
- Documentation changes  
- Branding and communication guidelines

Tokenomics itself (supply, decimals, contract address) is **not changeable**.

2. Founder and Maintainers review the proposal  
3. Feedback or discussion occurs openly
