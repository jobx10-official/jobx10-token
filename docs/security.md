## Key Principles

### Public Smart Contract

### No Hidden Functions
- No hidden minting  
- No admin mint rights  
- Fixed supply  

### No Upgradeable Proxy
The token contract is:
- Non-upgradeable  
- Immutable after deployment  

### Open Source
All code and documentation are publicly available on GitHub:
https://github.com/jobx10-official

### Liquidity Transparency
Liquidity is provided publicly through decentralized exchanges (DEX).
